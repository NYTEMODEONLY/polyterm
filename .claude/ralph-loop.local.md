Do a deep dive into our polyterm project here and ensure everything is up to date, test all features to make sure they work as intended. Ensure that there is a wallet input and trading mechanisms for end users. There is also a really big market for the 15m crypto markets that I'd like to add features and support for (https://polymarket.com/crypto/15M). After every update, ensure we commit to the github and submit any major updates to pypi for a release candidate.
